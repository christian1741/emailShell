emailShell
==========

A small code in Shell Script to send a "Friendly-Reminder" e-mail to a list of users. 

It has three components: 
  1. FridenlyReminderEmail.email
        This is the template of your remainder e-mail. 
  2. data.data
        This file is the DB for the users and the event details. Here you should modify the emails, data, and names. 
  3. main.sh
        This is the main code for the reminder program. 
        Here you should modify the paths (one for data.data and the other for FriendlyReminderEmail.email).
